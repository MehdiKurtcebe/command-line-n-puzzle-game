# command-line-n-puzzle-game
This is a simple N-Puzzle game played in command line.

I made this when I was learning OOP.

You can choose puzzle size from 3 to 9 (9 included).

You can shuffle the puzzle if you want.

You can export or import your puzzle.

If you're stuck, the program can solve the puzzle for you.

### Note: Since the algorithm that I used is very bad, program stucks like you if puzzle size is greater than 5. I was quite a beginner while writing this program.

This game has been tested on Ubuntu terminal and WSL terminal.

This game has been written according to c++11 standard.

## How to Compile
